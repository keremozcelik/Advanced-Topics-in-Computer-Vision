# Advanced-Topics-in-Computer-Vision

-Within the scope of Advanced Topics in Computer Vision course, the codes where basic image processing is performed and
contains input images.
-The code is written in python, spyder environment.

There are the following stages in the project:
      -Convert RGB to Grayscale to image
      -Histogram Computation
      -Automatic Thresholding Method
      -Background-Foreground with Threshold value
      -Adding Gaussian Noises
      -Low Pass Filter on Noisy image (Low pass filter = Mean Filter)
      -High Pass Filter on Noisy image (High pass filter = Laplacian Filter)
      -Median Filter for Salt-Pepper Noisy Image
